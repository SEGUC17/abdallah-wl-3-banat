Add these lines to the server.js:-

		- app.use(passport.initialize());
		- app.use(passport.session());


Things that need unification with the rest of the team :-

	- Routing with variables in url
	- business schema id is string
	- business schema rating "isn't enough to calculate avg"
	- List of requirements to be added in the routes:-
			- require('passport'); 	(added in this version)
			- require('jsonwebtoken');	(added in this version)
	- List of added requirements to the server :-
			- require('passport');

			
It's really better to split the routes from one file into 5, "1 for each actor"
as this will make tracing much easier.

Note that mongoose adds an s to the end of the collection name,
if u wanna force a certain collection name without s, just add it again as 
a third argument.
